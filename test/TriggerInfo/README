## How to find trigger names contributing to a given dataset for a given run range ##

1) Create list of runs with trigger key info 

- go to Run Summary
https://cmswbm.web.cern.ch/cmswbm/cmsdb/servlet/RunSummary
- select a run range 
"Begin RunNumber" --> "EndRunNumber" --> SubmitQuery
- save the output page as txt (option at the top)
  --> you'll get an output similar to RunSummary_160329_163876.txt
      (the file name has been changed manually)

2) Create the list of trigger key changes

- edit the script parse_run_summary.py (created by Edmund)
  - insert the .txt input file
- run the script : python parse_run_summary.py > Output_160329_163876.txt 
  --> the names starting with 
  */cdaq/physics/Run*
  correspond to HLT keys used in the run range relative to the Run Summary file

3) Find the trigger names for the path you are interested in

- Go to the HLT Browser: http://j2eeps.cern.ch/cms-project-confdb-hltdev/browser/
- Follow the path of each key in the file Output_160329_163876.txt (file created at step 2):
  - Example for /cdaq/physics/Run2011/5e32/v6.1/HLT/V8 :
    Go to /cdaq --> physics --> Run 2011 --> 5e32 -->  v6.1 --> HLT --> V8  
    --> a new frame will appear on the right of the page
- Select the stream (A, Calibration, etc..) and primary dataset (PD)
  --> Go To "A" (physics)
  --> Select the dataset you are interested in (i.e. SingleElectron)

The list of all trigger names contributing to *that dataset*, *in that HLT menu*, will appear:

HLT_Ele27_CaloIdVT_CaloIsoT_TrkIdT_TrkIsoT_v2	1	1	1	1		L1_SingleEG15
HLT_Ele32_CaloIdVT_CaloIsoT_TrkIdT_TrkIsoT_v1	1	1	1	1		L1_SingleEG20
HLT_Ele45_CaloIdVT_TrkIdT_v2			1	1	1	1		L1_SingleEG02
HLT_Ele90_NoSpikeFilter_v2			1	1	1	1		L1_SingleEG20

In case you use the code 
http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/UserCode/Leptoquarks/RootTupleMakerV2/python/RootTupleMakerV2_Trigger_cfi.py?view=log
------------

4) Save trigger info in the ntuples

- Edit the RootTupleMakerV2/python/RootTupleMakerV2_Trigger_cfi.py file, by *ADDING* (DO NOT REMOVE) in the list 
  new trigger names that you found at step 3).
   --> IMPORTANT : 
       since you are analyzing data from a long physics run, 
       - DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF THE EXISTING TRIGGER NAMES 
         (unless you really want to do it, and you need a good reason, contact us before), 
         , BUT JUST ADD THE NEW TRIGGERs AT THE END OF THE LIST 
         --> in this way one can still analyze old data if new ntuples are reproduced later.

- Repeat step 3) and 4) for each trigger key in the file Output_160329_163876.txt (file created at step 2):
